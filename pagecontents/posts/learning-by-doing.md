## Introduction
When I talk about learning programming I essentially mean the programming langauges. At least thats what I learned first.
The actual important concepts of how to structure a program or plan a project have been thaugt to me much later.

## My learning strategy
At first I didn't know anything about informatics, except that it was written in strange complex languages. So I started by doing some
research about them. I then figured out there were apps that would help me learn them for free. I therefore strated learning all possible
languages, but only the basics. After that I focused on one language, in my example I choose Python as it was easier to understand and seemed quite popular. \
And here starts my actual learning startegy: I choose a project/idea and started developing it, without prior knowledge or science, with only the basics I know. Then when I got stuck somewhere, I looked it up online and tried as good as I could to understand the proposed solution and implement it. Going on and on, I eventually finished my first project and learned a lot new about Python.

## Why its bad
The big downside of this strategy is that it requires a lot of effort and your finished project will look like a puzzle where you just picked random pieces from different boxes and glued them together. Since beginners tend to not follow best practices, using this strategy it might get even worse, as you could get used to code like this.

## Why its good
It is quite a simple approach and while learning you also get the statisfaction of creating your own small project. You can then abe proud of it as you created it yourself, following no specific tutorial. It might therefore reward you and it pushes you to start with what you have and expand your knowledge.

## Conclusion
We are all different and we also learn things different. This was my way of doing it and I'm still doing it today. But I know that others prefer following a tutorial and then expand the final result, which is completely fine. Just try and you will most certain find a way to learn for yourself. Coding is not as hard as it looks like and learning it can be quite rewarding and interesting. Furthermore, its a quite useful skill to have in life.
