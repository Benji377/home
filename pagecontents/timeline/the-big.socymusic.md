I decided to create my own big Android app by creating the open-source project "SocyMusic".
This project got massiv, bigger than I could have ever imagined, and I weren't able to keep up with it.
I learned a lot about how to manage a project and collaborate with others. I think this is one
of my most important projects so far.
